# Comparison Results Refactoring - Requirements Document

## Business Requirements

### BR-1: Visual Clarity Enhancement
**Requirement**: Replace color-coded background cards with neutral cards featuring data-driven progress visualization.

**Rationale**: Current implementation uses full-background colors (green, yellow, red) that create visual noise and make cross-comparison difficult. Users need to focus on the data, not decorative elements.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All metric cards have neutral white/off-white backgrounds
- Score visualization is achieved through internal progress bars only
- Visual hierarchy prioritizes data over decoration

### BR-2: Instant Data Comparison
**Requirement**: Enable users to instantly compare performance across locations for any given metric.

**Rationale**: Users need to quickly identify which location performs better in specific categories (Hospital, Demographics, etc.) without visual distraction.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Progress bars provide immediate visual comparison of scores
- Category winners are clearly identified with subtle badges
- All metrics follow consistent visual treatment

### BR-3: Professional Appearance
**Requirement**: Deliver a modern, professional interface suitable for business decision-making.

**Rationale**: The application is used for location analysis decisions. The interface must appear trustworthy and polished.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Clean, minimalist card design
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Subtle hover effects and transitions
- Professional color palette

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Progress Bar Visualization
**Requirement**: Display score data using horizontal progress bars with dynamic width and color.

**Technical Specification**:
- Progress bar width = score percentage (0-100%)
- Color coding:
  - Red (#E74C3C): scores < 36
  - Orange (#F39C12): scores 36-65
  - Green (#2ECC71): scores ≥ 66

**Test Cases**:
- Score 25 → 25% width, red color
- Score 50 → 50% width, orange color  
- Score 80 → 80% width, green color

### FR-2: Category Winner Identification
**Requirement**: Highlight the location with the highest score in each metric category.

**Technical Specification**:
- Compare all locations for each metric (Hospital, Demographics, etc.)
- Apply "En Yüksek" or ⭐ badge to winning card
- Handle ties by showing badge on all tied locations

**Test Cases**:
- Location A: Hospital 70, Location B: Hospital 45 → Badge on Location A
- Location A: Demographics 60, Location B: Demographics 60 → Badge on both

### FR-3: Responsive Layout
**Requirement**: Maintain layout integrity across desktop and mobile devices.

**Technical Specification**:
- Flexbox-based layout adapts to screen width
- Progress bars scale proportionally  
- Card spacing adjusts for touch interfaces

**Test Cases**:
- Desktop (1920px): Side-by-side comparison cards
- Tablet (768px): Stacked layout with full-width cards
- Mobile (375px): Single column with touch-friendly spacing

## Technical Requirements

- Memory usage remains stable

### TR-2: Accessibility Compliance
**Requirement**: Meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

**Specifications**:
- Progress bars include ARIA progressbar roles
- Color coding supplemented with text indicators
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility

**Test Cases**:
- Screen reader announces progress values correctly
- Tab navigation follows logical order
- Color contrast meets 4.5:1 ratio minimum

### TR-3: Browser Compatibility
**Requirement**: Support all browsers with >1% market share.

**Specifications**:

## User Experience Requirements

### UX-1: Cognitive Load Reduction
**Requirement**: Minimize mental effort required to compare locations.

**Design Principles**:
- Single visual encoding per data point (progress bar)
- Consistent interaction patterns
- Predictable layout structure

**Success Metrics**:
- Users can identify best location in <5 seconds
- Reduce visual scanning time by 40%

### UX-2: Data Trust and Confidence
**Requirement**: Build user confidence in data accuracy through clear presentation.

**Design Principles**:
- Precise numerical values visible alongside visual elements
- Clean, uncluttered presentation
- Professional typography and spacing

**Success Metrics**:
- Users express confidence in accuracy
- Reduced questions about data validity

### UX-3: Efficient Decision Making
**Requirement**: Support rapid business decisions through optimized information architecture.

**Design Principles**:
- Most important data (winners) highlighted appropriately
- Secondary information available but not distracting
- Clear visual hierarchy guides attention

**Success Metrics**:
- Decision time reduced by 30%
- Increased user satisfaction with comparison process

## Data Requirements

### DR-1: Score Normalization
**Requirement**: All scores must be normalized to 0-100 scale for consistent progress bar representation.

**Validation Rules**:
- Input scores: 0 ≤ score ≤ 100
- Handle null/undefined scores as 0
- Round to nearest integer for display

### DR-2: Winner Calculation Accuracy
**Requirement**: Category winners must be calculated correctly across all comparison scenarios.
