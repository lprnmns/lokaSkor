# Requirements Document

## Introduction

LocationIQ'nun mod1-comparison sayfasında, lokasyon karşılaştırma sonuçlarında her metrik için renkli progress barları görünmüyor. Kullanıcılar skorları sadece sayı olarak görebiliyor ancak görsel olarak hangi metriğin ne kadar iyi olduğunu anlayamıyor. Bu özellik, kullanıcı deneyimini iyileştirmek ve skorları daha anlaşılır hale getirmek için gereklidir.

2. WHEN the progress bar is displayed THEN the bar color SHALL change from red (low scores) to green (high scores) based on the score value
3. WHEN multiple locations are compared THEN each location's progress bars SHALL be clearly visible and distinguishable

4. WHEN the score changes THEN the color transition SHALL be smooth and gradual

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the progress bars to be visually consistent with the overall design, so that the interface looks professional and cohesive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN progress bars are displayed THEN they SHALL match the existing design system colors and styling
2. WHEN progress bars are rendered THEN they SHALL have proper rounded corners and smooth animations
3. WHEN the page loads THEN progress bars SHALL animate from 0% to their target percentage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the progress bars to work reliably across different browsers and devices, so that I can access the feature consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria
